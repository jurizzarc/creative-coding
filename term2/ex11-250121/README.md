# Exercise 11: Random Walk
The sketch shows the random path of an ellipse that has any colour grabbed from a defined colour palette.

## Moving the ellipse
The ellipse walks or moves in six possible directions. These directions are defined in an array.
```javascript
let optionsX = [-1, 0, 1];
let optionsY = [-1, 0, 1];
```

To move the ellipse, the direction is first generated by using the `random()` function to get a value out of the `optionsX` and `optionsY` arrays. The ellipse, which starts at the centre of the canvas, moves based on these random values and the step size. Perlin noise is also applied.
```javascript
let x, y;
let diam = 12;
let step = diam/2;
let t = 0;

function setup() {
    [...]
    x = width/2;
    y = height/2;
}

function draw() {
    let randX = floor(random(0, optionsX.length));
    let randY = floor(random(0, optionsY.length));
    let moveX = optionsX[randX] * step * noise(t);
    let moveY = optionsY[randY] * step * noise(t);
    x += moveX;
    y += moveY;
    t += 0.03;
}
```

The `x` and `y` positions of the ellipse are checked if they are under 0 or higher than the canvas width and height so that the ellipse moves within the boundaries of the canvas.
```javascript
function draw() {
    [...]
    if (x < 0) x = width;
    if (x > width) x = 0;
    if (y < 0) y = height;
    if (y > height) y = 0;
}
```

## Drawing the ellipse
The random colour is generated the same way as the direction of the ellipse is created. It is taken from the `colours` array which consists of six colours.

```javascript
function setup() {
    [...]
    colours = [
    color(107, 61, 79),
    color(148, 76, 102),
    color(180, 111, 131),
    color(244, 118, 154),
    color(253, 138, 178),
    color(247, 166, 188)
    ];
}

function draw() {
    [...]
    let randC = floor(random(0, colours.length));
    let colour = colours[randC];
    noStroke();
    fill(colour);
    ellipse(x, y, diam);
}
```
