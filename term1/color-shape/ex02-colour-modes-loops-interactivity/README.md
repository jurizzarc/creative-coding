# Colour Modes, Loops, and Interactivity
Exercise 02 â€“ 29 Sep 2020

### Adding interactivity
The mouse position can be used in a variety of ways to control properties of elements on the canvas. To get the mouse position, the *mouseX*, and *mouseY* variables are used. These store the x and y coordinates of the cursor relative to the origin (0, 0) of the canvas.
