      <p>
        For our first assignment, we created a wrapping paper pattern using the p5.js library. This pattern will be
        printed out on an A3 sheet of paper. The pattern I made was inspired by the basic types of weaving patterns: plain, twill, and
        satin.
      </p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The canvas contains a grid and this grid is made up of 100 grid cells. A warp and a weft thread is drawn on
        each grid cell. On the canvas, the warp threads look like vertical rectangles, while the weft threads look like horizontal
        rectangles. Depending on the type of weaving pattern chosen by the user, the warp is either drawn over the weft,
        or drawn under the weft. The grid and the threads are objects created from a class called <code>Thread</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The properties of an object created from the <code>Thread</code> class are the index numbers <code>i</code> and
        <code>j</code>, the width and height of the grid cell, and the size of the thread.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
class Thread {
  constructor(_i, _j) {
    this.i = _i;
    this.j = _j;
    this.cw = cellWidth;
    this.ch = cellHeight;
    this.ts = threadSize;
  }
}
      </code></pre>

        <p>
          The width and height of the grid cell depend on the width and height of the canvas and the number of grid cells. 
          The following variables are defined globally.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
const canvasWidth = 1754;
const canvasHeight = 2481;
let numOfCells = 10;
let cellWidth = canvasWidth / numOfCells;
let cellHeight = canvasHeight / numOfCells;
        </code></pre>

        <p>The following are also global variables that will be used to create the threads.</p>

        <pre><code>
const colorPalettes = [
  ['#900C3E', '#50163F', '#FF5835', '#A90031'],
  ['#B41D01', '#960000', '#FFCB18', '#FCB600'],
  ['#DB1C1A', '#AE1417', '#3E8B54', '#2E5033'],
  ['#004445', '#011C1D', '#6FB98F', '#2C7873']
];

let colorIndex = [0, 1, 2, 3];
let paletteIndex = 0;
let currentPalette;
let weaveType = 'Plain';
let threadSize = 3;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          <code>colorPalettes</code> holds an array of colour palettes for the pattern, each defined as an array of 4 hex values. 
          <code>colorIndex</code> holds an array of the index position of the hex values. <code>paletteIndex</code> refers to the 
          index position of the colour palette that is used on the canvas. The value stored in <code>paletteIndex</code> changes 
          when the user presses the right arrow key. This is one of the ways the user can interact with the sketch. 
        </p>

        <pre><code>
function keyPressed() {
  if (keyCode === RIGHT_ARROW) {
      paletteIndex = (paletteIndex + 1) % colorPalettes.length;
  } 
  redraw();
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          To create the thread objects, I first initialised an empty array to the global variable <code>threads</code> and the number 
          of grid cells is set to 10.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
let threads = [];
let numOfCells = 10;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          I then populated the <code>threads</code> array in <code>setup()</code> with the objects made from the <code>Thread</code> class. 
          The array now holds 100 objects.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  smooth();
  noLoop();

  for (let i = 0; i < numOfCells; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < numOfCells; j++) {
        threads.push(new Thread(i, j));
    }
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          In the <code>Thread</code> class, I created a method called <code>render()</code>. When called, this method draws the grid and the weave 
          pattern on the canvas. I made use of transformations so that each object made from the <code>Thread</code> class gets drawn 
          within the canvas. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the code snippet below, the <code>render()</code> method draws a square with no fill and has a black outline on the 
          canvas. The point of origin is set to the x and y positions of the grid cell, added to half the width and height of 
          the grid cell. Those values are added because <code>rectMode</code> is set to CENTER. Without those values, the objects would be 
          positioned slightly off the canvas.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
render() {
  push();
  let cellX = this.i * this.cw + this.cw / 2;
  let cellY = this.j * this.ch + this.ch / 2;
  translate(cellX, cellY);
  noFill();
  stroke('#000');
  rect(0, 0, this.cw, this.ch);
  pop();
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Weave is the interlacing of warp and weft threads at right angles in order to produce a woven fabric. To imitate 
          this in p5.js, I started with the simplest of all basic weaves which is the plain weave. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of the index numbers that are set to the <code>this.i</code> and <code>this.j</code> properties is so that I can assign each 
          grid cell with a number and to make sure that the way the warp and weft threads are interlaced on the sketch will depend
          on the type of weave chosen by the user. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially, each grid cell were assigned two numbers, but to make the calculations easier, I added these two numbers 
          together. For example, if a grid cell's <code>i</code> index number is 1 and its <code>j</code> index number is also 1 (1, 1) then its index number is 2. In the <code>render()</code> method, I added the following line of code before <code>pop()</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
let indexNum = this.i + this.j;
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          To position the threads in the center of a grid cell, the value set to the <code>this.ts</code> property is multiplied to 2. 
          I stored the product in the variable <code>threadPos</code>. This value will be later divided to the height or width of the grid 
          cell. Four colours taken from the current colour palette on the canvas are also defined. I added the following lines 
          of code after initialising <code>indexNum</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
let threadPos = this.ts * 2;
let col1 = currentPalette[colorIndex[0]];
let col2 = currentPalette[colorIndex[1]];
let col3 = currentPalette[colorIndex[2]];
let col4 = currentPalette[colorIndex[3]];
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          The plain weave is made by interlacing warp and weft threads in an alternate manner. To create this pattern, I used 
          conditional statements to check if the index number of a grid cell is an even number. If it is, the warp thread is 
          drawn over the weft thread. Otherwise, the weft thread is drawn over the warp thread.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
if (weaveType == 'Plain') {
  // Draw warp over weft
  if (indexNum % 2 == 0) {
      // Weft Threads
      stroke(col1);
      fill(col1);
      rect(0, -this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch/this.ts);
      stroke(col2);
      fill(col2);
      rect(0, this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch/this.ts);
      // Warp Threads
      stroke(col3)
      fill(col3);
      rect(-this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw/this.ts, this.ch);
      stroke(col4);
      fill(col4);
      rect(this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw/this.ts, this.ch);
  // Draw weft over warp
  } else {
      // Warp Threads
      stroke(col3)
      fill(col3);
      rect(-this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw/this.ts, this.ch);
      stroke(col4);
      fill(col4);
      rect(this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw/this.ts, this.ch);
      // Weft Threads
      stroke(col1);
      fill(col1);
      rect(0, -this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch/this.ts);
      stroke(col2);
      fill(col2);
      rect(0, this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch/this.ts);
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          The weft threads are created by placing two rectangles beside each other. The height of the weft thread is set to the 
          height of the grid cell divided by the size of the thread. Its y position is set to the height of the grid cell divided 
          by the value stored in the <code>threadPos</code> variable earlier. The height and the y position are set this way to make sure 
          that the weft thread is horizontally centered in a grid cell. The warp threads are created in a similar way, but in reverse.
        </p>

        <p>
          To view the plain weave pattern, I called the <code>render()</code> method on each object created from
          the <code>Thread</code> class in the <code>draw()</code> function.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
function draw() {
  background(bgColor);
  currentPalette = colorPalettes[paletteIndex];
  threads.forEach(thread => {
      thread.render();
  });
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          The approach I took to generate a plain weave pattern was repeated to create the twill and satin weave patterns. To reuse the code, in the class <code>Thread</code>, 
          I created the method <code>makeWeave()</code> that takes two parameters: <code>_type</code> which refers to the type of the weave pattern and <code>_num</code> which refers 
          to the integer the index number will be divided to.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
makeWeave(_type, _num) {
  let indexNum = this.i + this.j;
  let threadPos = this.ts * 2; 
  let col1 = currentPalette[colorIndex[0]];
  let col2 = currentPalette[colorIndex[1]];
  let col3 = currentPalette[colorIndex[2]];
  let col4 = currentPalette[colorIndex[3]];

  if (weaveType == _type) {
    // Draw warp over weft
    if (indexNum % _num == 0) {
      // Weft Threads
      stroke(col1);
      fill(col1);
      rect(0, -this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch / this.ts);
      stroke(col2);
      fill(col2);
      rect(0, this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch / this.ts);
      // Warp Threads
      stroke(col3)
      fill(col3);
      rect(-this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw / this.ts, this.ch);
      stroke(col4);
      fill(col4);
      rect(this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw / this.ts, this.ch);
    // Draw weft over warp
    } else {
      // Warp Threads
      stroke(col3)
      fill(col3);
      rect(-this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw / this.ts, this.ch);
      stroke(col4);
      fill(col4);
      rect(this.cw/threadPos, 0, this.cw / this.ts, this.ch);
      // Weft Threads
      stroke(col1);
      fill(col1);
      rect(0, -this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch / this.ts);
      stroke(col2);
      fill(col2);
      rect(0, this.ch/threadPos, this.cw, this.ch / this.ts);
    }
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          I then called the <code>makeWeave()</code> method for each weave type in <code>render()</code>.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
this.makeWeave('Plain', 2);
this.makeWeave('Twill', 3);
this.makeWeave('Satin', 4);
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Lastly, I included an interface built using dat.GUI to let the user control
          the appearance of the weave pattern.
        </p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Below are some weave patterns that I made on the program.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="samples/sample1.png" alt="Weave Pattern 1">
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="samples/sample4.png" alt="Weave Pattern 4">
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="samples/sample5.png" alt="Weave Pattern 5">
        </figure>

        <h3>What could be improved</h3>
        <p>
          To take this pattern further, I would look at better references and let the user have more control over
          how the threads get drawn on the canvas. I would think of a more effective way than using modulo division to 
          recreate a weave pattern. And to better the aesthetics, I would use better colour palettes and apply shadows. The threads could
          also be drawn in different ways instead of just horizontally or vertically.
