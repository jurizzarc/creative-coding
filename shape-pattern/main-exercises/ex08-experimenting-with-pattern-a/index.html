      <p>
        The circle pattern created in the <a href="../ex07-rotate-towards-mouse/index.html">previous exercise</a> was used as a basis
        for developing the line pattern in this exercise. Randomness and random seed were applied to generate the line pattern.
      </p>

      <h3>The Shape class</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the circle objects, the lines drawn on the canvas are created from the <code>Shape</code> class.
        Each line has the following properties.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
class Shape {
  constructor(_i, _j) {
    this.i = _i;
    this.j = _j;
    this.s = shapeSize;
    this.x = this.i * this.s; 
    this.y = this.j * this.s; 
    this.sw = 1;
  }
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        <code>this.i</code> and <code>this.j</code> are index numbers. <code>this.s</code> is initialised to 
        the value assigned to the global variable <code>shapeSize</code>. <code>this.x</code> and <code>this.y</code>
        are offset properties that make sure the lines will be drawn within the canvas. <code>this.sw</code>
        refers to the stroke weight of the line and it is initialised to 1. This value changes depending on the current mouse position. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Generating random numbers</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>random()</code> function can be used to add variety to patterns. This function returns a random value of float type. It takes 0, 1, or
        two arguments. In this exercise, the numbers 0 and 1 are passed into <code>random()</code> and whatever value is returned by the function,
        the <code>round()</code> function rounds the random value to the nearest integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "rising" diagonal line is generated if the random value, which is stored in the <code>randomNum</code> variable, is equal to 0. If it is 
        equal to 1, a "falling" diagonal line is generated. The diagonal line goes from one corner of
        the shape across to the opposite corner.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
render() {
  push();
  translate(this.x, this.y);

  col = color(this.i, 0, numOfShapes - this.j);
  strokeWeight(this.sw);
  stroke(col);
  randomNum = round(random(0, 1));
  if (randomNum == 0) {
    line(0, this.s, this.s, 0);
  } else {
    line(0, 0, this.s, this.s);
  }
  
  pop();
}
      </code></pre>
      
      <h3>Using randomSeed()</h3>
      <p>
        We get different sequences of random values because the <code>random()</code> function is called on each shape object every time 
        the <code>draw()</code> function executes. To control randomness, <code>randomSeed()</code> is added to <code>draw()</code> so that
        <code>random()</code> would always return the same sequence of random values.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
function draw() {
  background(0);
  randomSeed(10);
  shapes.forEach(shape => {
    shape.render();
  });
}
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Changing the stroke weight of each line</h3>
      <p>
        To implement mouse interactivity in the sketch, the stroke weight of each diagonal line
        changes according to the current mouse position. The following code is included in the 
        <code>render()</code> method after translation.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
d = dist(mouseX, mouseY, this.x, this.y);
this.sw = map(d, 0, width, 2, 7);
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>dist()</code> function calculates the distance between the mouse position and the diagonal line. The result is scaled 
        from a range between 0 and the width to a range between 2 and 7.
