**To customise the wrapping paper**
- Press the right arrow key to change the colour palette.
- Use the GUI on the upper right side of the screen. *showGrid* displays the cells where each thread is drawn in. *showIndex* displays the index number of each cell. You can select the type of basic weave pattern from the *weaveTypes* select element. The width or height of the cell is divided by the *threadSize*. *hasBlendMode* applies the blendMode(MULTIPLY), and blends the colours of the thread.
- To save the pattern, right click on the canvas, and select *Save Image As...*

Samples of weave patterns are in the *samples* folder.
