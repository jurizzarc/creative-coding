      <p>
        In this class, we were introduced to colour interpolation and how to apply it to your graphics.
      </p>

      <h3>Storing colours into variables</h3>
      <p>
        Colour interpolation works by finding a third colour between two colours. The <code>color()</code> function 
        can be used to define these two colours. Depending on the colour mode set with the <code>colorMode()</code> function,
        the parameters passed to the <code>color()</code> function are interpreted as RGB or HSB values. For this exercise,
        the colour mode is set to <code>HSB</code> in <code>setup()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To show how colour interpolation works, I first drew 100 squares on the canvas. 10 on each column and 10 on each row.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
function draw() {
  for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < 10; y++) {
      noStroke();
      rect(x * 50 + 10, y * 50 + 10, 20, 20);
    }
  }
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        The two colours which would be used for colour interpolation are created and stored into variables <code>startColor</code> and
        <code>endColor</code>. The first colour has a hue of 360 degrees, while the second colour has a hue of 180 degrees. The following
        lines of code were added before <code>noStroke();</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
let startColor = color(360, 100, 100);
let endColor = color(180, 100, 100);
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Finding a third colour between two colours</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>lerpColor()</code> function finds a third colour between two colours by interpolating them. The amount of
        interpolation between these colours are based on a number between 0 and 1. This function accepts three parameters:
        the first colour or in this exercise, the colour stored in the <code>starColor</code> variable, the second colour (<code>endColor</code>),
        and the interpolation amount. As shown in the code below, the interpolation amount is set to the <code>x</code> value divided by
        10, which would return a float value. If the value is equal to 0.1, then it is near the first colour. 0.9 is near the 
        second colour and 0.5 is between those colours.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
let c = lerpColor(startColor, endColor, x/10);
fill(c);
      </code></pre>
