      <p>
        The p5.js library includes the functions <code>beginShape()</code>, <code>endShape()</code>, and <code>vertex()</code> which allow us to create more complex shapes. 
        In this exercise, these functions were used to draw the HSB colour wheel.
      </p>

      <h3>Setting up the canvas</h3>
      <p>
        By default, the mode in which the angles would be interpreted and calculated is set to <code>RADIANS</code>. In this exercise, the
        <code>angleMode()</code> is set to <code>DEGREES</code>. The <code>colorMode</code>, similar to 
        the previous exercises, is set to <code>HSB</code>. This is because we're creating a colour wheel.
        Each major colour on the HSB colour wheel are at 30 degree intervals. Other initial properties
        that are defined for this exercise are the width and height of the canvas and the background colour.
        The outline of the shapes are also disabled by the <code>noStroke()</code> function.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
  background(224);
  angleMode(DEGREES);
  colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100);
  noStroke();
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The following are values needed to create the colour wheel. These values are
        defined in the <code>setup()</code> function.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
centerX = width/2;
centerY = height/2;
numOfSegments = 12;
stepAngle = 360/numOfSegments;
radius = 100;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>centerX</code> and <code>centerY</code> values will be used to place the centre 
        point of the colour wheel on the centre of the canvas. The <code>numOfSegments</code> refers
        to the number of points of the colour wheel. <code>stepAngle</code> determines the angle
        at which a point is drawn within the colour wheel and the <code>radius</code> is the
        distance between the centre and the boundary of the colour wheel.
      </p>

      <h3>Drawing the colour wheel</h3>
      <p>
        To draw the HSB colour wheel, I used the <code>beginShape()</code>, <code>endShape()</code>,
        and <code>vertex()</code> functions. <code>beginShape()</code> starts recording the vertices
        that define the form of a complex shape. This function accepts a parameter which affects the kind
        of shape that would be drawn. In this exercise, I passed the <code>TRIANGLE_FAN</code>
        constant to the <code>beginShape()</code> function, which should draw the segments
        of the colour wheel. The <code>endShape()</code> function is called to end the recording and to
        complete the complex shape. The <code>vertex()</code> function has to be used within <code>beginShape()</code>
        and <code>endShape</code>. The vertex coordinates for the custom shape are defined by using this function.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
function draw() {
  beginShape(TRIANGLE_FAN);
    vertex(centerX, centerY);
    for (let i = 0; i <= 360; i += stepAngle) {
      let vx = (radius * cos(i)) + centerX;
      let vy = (radius * sin(i)) + centerY;
      fill(i, 100, 100);
      vertex(vx, vy);
    }
  endShape();
}
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        In the above code, the custom shape starts at the centre of the canvas. This point would
        be the centre of the colour wheel. It is followed by a <code>for</code> loop. This loop initialises i (which represents an angle) to 0, checks that i 
        is less than 360 (360 degrees is a full circle), draws a segment of the colour wheel, and increments i by
        30 (This is the quotient of 360/12 and as previously mentioned, the major colours are at 30 degree intervals on the HSB colour wheel). 
        Within the <code>for</code> loop, the rest of the vertices are drawn. A segment of the colour wheel looks like
        a triangle and we have its hypotenuse already, the value assigned to the <code>radius</code> variable. To find the adjacent
        side, the radius is multiplied by the cosine of i and the product is added to 
        a centre point, the <code>centreX</code> value. If the product is not added to the centre point,
        the segment would be placed incorrectly on the canvas. The adjacent value is stored in the <code>vx</code>
        variable. The opposite side is calculated in a similar way but in reverse. The opposite value is stored in 
        the <code>vy</code> variable. The adjacent and opposite values are vertices and are passed to the 
        <code>vertex()</code> function. The hue colour of each segment depends on the angle.
